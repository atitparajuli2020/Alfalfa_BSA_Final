# Alfalfa_BSA_Final
GWAS for Alfalfa BSA samples using FarmCPU

For this project we used 215 Alfalfa plants from three location (Washington 100, Utah 100 and Wisconsin 15) to self for 2 generation. With each 
generation of selfing we selected pairs of strong vigor and weak vigor plants within a line. These selected plants based on their health is used for final association analysis. For the final Analysis, 121 plants were chosen with stong coded as 1 and weak coded as 0 for association analysis. Along with this, we used location, generation, pools and group as covariates. Three location (Washington, Utah as 0 and Wisconsin as 1), two generation (Generation 1 as 0 and Genetion 2 as 1), pools (individual as 0 and pool as 1) and group which was the separate cluster when plotting Principal Component 1 and Principal Component 2.
